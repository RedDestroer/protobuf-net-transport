# protobuf-net-transport

protobuf-net-transport is a .NET library that makes it possible to create files that carry a payload in the form of a set of object graphs serialized through a proto-buffer.

Library uses [protobuf-net](https://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net) to make it possible to serialize and deserialize data.

If you need to transfer offline data as files, then this library can be useful to you, as it unifies the process of serialization / deserialization of payloads and their transportation.
